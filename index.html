    <h2>Founders</h2>
    <p>
        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was <u>founded</u> in 2015 by Michael
        Hartl, Lee
        Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
        sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
        <b>at least a billion people</b>, <strong> <em>and probably more.</em> </strong>
    </p>

    <h3>Michael Hartl</h3>

        Michael is the creator of the <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">
            Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
        <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to Be
            Dangerous</a>
        introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of
        <a href="https://www.kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a> and has a
        three-step
        plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a
        supervillain
        are slightly exaggerated.

        When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder
        stashes
        on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer
        designing
        interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
        interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

    <p>
        You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities
        on Jimmy
        Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a
        true nerd
        at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code
        from a
        tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
